# Diabetes-Detection-System-using-C-

<p>Diabetes is a growing health concern worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective management. This project presents a C++-based diabetes detection system that enables users to perform a self-checkup by answering diagnostic questions and entering laboratory results. The system utilizes a knowledge-based expert system to analyze patient data and determine the likelihood of diabetes, providing diagnostic results and general health recommendations. With a user-friendly text-based interface, the software assists both individuals and medical practitioners in early detection and record-keeping. This tool aims to enhance diabetes diagnosis by integrating intelligent decision-making techniques.</p>
